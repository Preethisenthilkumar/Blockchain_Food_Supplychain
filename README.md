# Blockchain for food Supply chain traceability system

As customers we expect the product we purchase to be safe and would like to know the entire product history. We hear a lot of food scams and recall. It takes about two to three weeks for the FDA to traceback to the problem. But the FDA has to be quick and right in finding the problem.

The aim of this project is to provide the customers proof that the product is safe. For the FDA, entire product history with immutable transaction logs to traceback to the problem in minutes. The participants of the food supply chain can hold their own records of data and use safe method for transaction.
